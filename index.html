# Pronunciation: 
It is very common for non-Hindi speakers to mispronounce this name and turn it into insulting/abusive without even intending to do it.  It is very important to pay heed to the sounds of the words in Indian languages (this is one of the reasons why Indian accents there are twice the number of alphabets in Hind (52) as compared to English (26)). Hence more sounds as compared 😊. 

The way this name is pronounces as is <span style="color:red"> `Haar- thee – ik (Har ðiː ik)` </span> and **definitely not*** as: `Hardick` <br />
Here the alphabet d is pronounced as other English language words like `Thee, Thou (from Shakespearean English) or **The, Then and Though**`.
 **NOT** alphabet D as in **Don, Dear or Denmark.**
