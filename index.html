<h1> <span style="color:blue">  Meaning </h1></br> </span>
You might already know that every Indian name has a meaning :). The word <b>Hardik</b> <img src="name.png"> is a Hindi word which means “From the core of the Heart” or “<b> Whole Heartedly</b>” or “<b>Heart Felt</b>”. <br /><br />
 Example: “Hardik Svaagat”  <img src="swagat.png"> which in English mean <b>Heartfelt Welcome </b> OR Hardik shubhkamna (Heartfelt wishes) 
This is something you may get to read this name in most of the places in India like on: hoardings, city/country entrances etc or festive wishes<br /> <br />

<h1> <span style="color:blue"> Pronunciation </span> </h1></br>  
It is very common for non-Hindi speakers to mispronounce this name, but remember <b>it may sound insulting or abusive to the person on recieving end </b>.  
It is very important to pay heed to the sounds of the words in Indian languages (There are twice the number of alphabets in Hind (52) as compared to English (26)). Hence more sounds as compared 😊). 

The way this name is pronounces as is <span style="color:red"> `Haar- thee – ik (Har ðiː ik)` </span> and <b>Definitely Not</b> as: <span style="color:red"> `Hardick` <br /> </span> <br />
Here the alphabet d is pronounced as most common words of English language like <span style="color:green"> <b>The, Then and Though</b>` or <b> Thee, Thou (from Shakespearean English) </b>.
 </span> <b>NOT</b> as "D" in  <b>Don, Dear or Denmark or "Th" in Think, Thor or Thankyou.</b>  <br /> <br /> Dont make that mistake :) <br /> <br />

Below is the example on how it should be pronounced: <br /> <br />
<objectwidth="300"height="50"><paramname="src"value="nameaudio.mp3"><paramname="autoplay"value="false"><paramname="controller"value="true"><paramname="bgcolor"value="#FFFFFF"><embedsrc="nameaudio.mp3"autostart="false"loop="false"width="300"height="50"controller="true"bgcolor="#FFFFFF"></object>
