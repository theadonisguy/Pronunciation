<h1> <span style="color:blue">  Meaning </h1></br> </span>
The word <b>Hardik</b> <img src="name.png"> is a Hindi word which means “From the core of the Heart” or “<b> Whole Heartedly</b>” or “<b>Heart Felt</b>”. <br /><br />
 Example: “Hardik Svaagat”  <img src="swagat.png"> which in English mean Heartfelt Welcome.  OR Hardik shubhkamna (Heartfelt Congratulations) 
This is something you may get to read this name in most of the places in India like on: hoardings, city/country entrances etc. <br /> <br />

<h1> <span style="color:blue"> Pronunciation </span> </h1></br>  
It is very common for non-Hindi speakers to mispronounce this name and turn it into insulting/abusive without even intending to do it.  It is very important to pay heed to the sounds of the words in Indian languages (this is one of the reasons why Indian accents there are twice the number of alphabets in Hind (52) as compared to English (26)). Hence more sounds as compared 😊. 

The way this name is pronounces as is <span style="color:red"> `Haar- thee – ik (Har ðiː ik)` </span> and <b>Definitely Not</b> as: <span style="color:red"> `Hardick` <br /> </span> <br />
Here the alphabet d is pronounced as other English language words like <span style="color:green"> <b> Thee, Thou (from Shakespearean English) </b> or <b>The, Then and Though</b>`.
 </span> <b>NOT</b> alphabet D as in <b>Don, Dear or Denmark.</b>  <br /> <br />

<br /> <br /> Hope next time you meet a person named Hardik; you call him with his correct name 😊
